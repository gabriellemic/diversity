# Open Innovation - Diversity + Inclusion + Belonging

We welcome all contributors and are eager together, but due to the highly confidential nature of much of the work, there are currently only occasional tasks available for non-staff contributors in regard to Mozilla. 

All of the information of externally-facing work, links, and resources from Mozilla can be [found on this wiki](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Diversity_and_Inclusion_for_Communities_and_Contributors); as well as joinging the [D&I in Open Source Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/diversity--inclusion-in-open-source) to connect with thee team, and others accross the open source ecosystem working on inclusion.
