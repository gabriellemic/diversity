# Open Innovation - Diversity + Inclusion + Belonging

We welcome all contributors and are eager together, but due to the highly confidential nature of much of our work, we currently only have occasional tasks available for non-staff contributors. 

All of the information of externally facing work, links, and reosources for Mozilla can be [found on our wiki here](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Diversity_and_Inclusion_for_Communities_and_Contributors); as well as joinging the [D&I in Open Source Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/diversity--inclusion-in-open-source) to connect with thee team, and others accross the open source ecosystem working on inclusion.
