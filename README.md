# Open Innovation - Diversity + Inclusion + Belonging

Welcoming all contributors with eagerness to work together. Due to the highly confidential nature of much of the work, there are currently only occasional tasks available for non-staff contributors in regard to the original Mozilla repository. 

All of the information of externally-facing work, links, and resources from Mozilla can be [found on this wiki](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Diversity_and_Inclusion_for_Communities_and_Contributors); as well as joinging the [D&I in Open Source Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/diversity--inclusion-in-open-source) to connect with the team, and others accross the open source ecosystem working on inclusion.
